# StockFilter

StockFilter is born on a flight when I came back to Toronto from Shanghai. <br /> <br />
During the flight, my friend who majors in Finance complained to me that different Technical indicators could provide enough information about stocks ,but they are hard to watch and inspect. What we want is just a piece of mind.   <br /> <br />
At the end of the day, we decided to designe and implement StockFilter as a analysis tool or "filter" to help investor in share market to simply choose some potential stocks . <br /> <br />
Analysis engine is built with C++ and C, based on Trend Line and Technical indicator in Shanghai Stock Exchange.  (GUI is still being developed)
