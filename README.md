# StockFilter

StockFilter is born on a flight when I came back to Toronto from Shanghai. 
During flight, my friend who majors in Finance complains to me that different Technical indicators could provide so much information about a Company's Financial health circumstance ,but there isn't any share analysis tool.
At the end of the day, we designed and implemented StockFilter as a analysis tool to help investor in share market to better analyse different shares.
Analysis engine is built with C++ and C, based on Trend Line and Technical indicator in Shanghai Stock Exchange.  (GUI is still being developed)
